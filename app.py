# Make routes for the following:
# GET /api/cupcakes : Get data about all cupcakes. Respond with JSON like: {cupcakes: [{id, flavor, size, rating, image}, ...]}. The values should come from each cupcake instance.
# GET /api/cupcakes/[cupcake-id] : Get data about a single cupcake. Respond with JSON like: {cupcake: {id, flavor, size, rating, image}}. This should raise a 404 if the cupcake cannot be found.
# POST /api/cupcakes : Create a cupcake with flavor, size, rating and image data from the body of the request. Respond with JSON like: {cupcake: {id, flavor, size, rating, image}}.
# Test that these routes work in Insomnia.
# Weâ€™ve provided tests for these three routes; these test should pass if the routes work properly.
# You can run our tests like:
# (venv) $python -m unittest -v tests
